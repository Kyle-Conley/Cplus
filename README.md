# Cplusplus-Program

Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.

This program designs an interactive system that allows users to track their investments with or without monthly deposits, while also compounding interest for each scenario. The data is displayed in seperate and easily identifiable tables. 

What did you do particularly well?

The design for this program is easily understood with proper naming standards. It also uses different functions for with-monthly and without-monthly deposits to easily integrate into main. I also added inline comments that demonstrate the functionaility of the program in any instance not easily understood.  


Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
Since this project, I have used C++ in collaboration with Python for ease of use when defining functions. In this instance, it would have been simple to add a .py file to the program and to use this for the functions. Inside my C++ main file, I can now pull from the .py file. 

Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this?

Initially, the area that took me longest to write in this code was the pointers. The idea of pointers was a bit different than what I was used to in Java, but does now seem more intuitive.

What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
The skill of wokring through different files is something I will continue to work through and increasing my comfortablitlity with. 

How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
This program is easily understood and can be maintained by most programmers with knowledge of software development. The comments are especially useful for later use by different teams.
